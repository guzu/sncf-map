# Overview
This is essentially a static PDF viewer using LeafletJS.
In this case this is useful to convert a big map in PDF of France railways that is
barely browsable on a PC to a nice web version. <br>
For the auhtor this is mostly useful to plan bicycle trips.

# Hint
Do not forget to comment every limits in /etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml to
be able to work with the largest image
